Solving the inverse лю/EEG problem using machine learning algorithms


In this work, a model of excitations in the brain and a method for solving the inverse M/EEG problem using a recurrent neural network were proposed.

In publications, the localization problem is solved for point sources - dipoles (taken from a small area of the brain in the volume of 45 pieces). The code uploaded here is devoted to localization of excited regions in the brain and testing the algorithm on real data.
